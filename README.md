Chlorophyll biosynthesis genes tree files can be accessed at: https://itol.embl.de/shared/34y3BUHcQd7Lh

Extended_data_for_Heatmaps.xlsx file contains separate sheets corresponding to Figures 2 through 7 with the protein IDs from individual genomes. Individual protein sequences can be found in the corresponding faa file.

ExtendedData_IMG_ALL.xlsx file contains separate sheets for each order with the list of 16S rRNA sequence hits in the IMG database, along with their ecosystem description and classification. These data were used to construct the bar charts in Figure S1.

ExtendedData_NCBI_ALL.xlsx file contains separate sheets for each order with the list of 16S rRNA sequence hits in the NCBI nt database, along with their ecosystem description and classification. These data were used to construct the bar charts in Figure 9.
