Extended data 1. Different sheets correspond to the heatmaps in Figures 2 through 7 in the main text. Each sheet references the protein IDs in each of the 108 Binatota genomes corresponding to the gene in the column header. The actual amino acid sequences can be found in the amino acid fasta files by searching by the protein ID in the corresponding file.

Extended data 2. Different sheets correspond to different Binatota orders. Each sheet lists the accession numbers, source, and ecosystem-level classification of the NCBI nt database hits identified using Blastn. These data were used to construct Figure 9.

Extended data 3. Different sheets correspond to different Binatota orders. Each sheet lists the accession numbers, source, and ecosystem-level classification of the IMG database hits identified using Blastn. These data were used to construct Figure S1.
